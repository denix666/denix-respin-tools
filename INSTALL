Fedora 14,15,16 - you have to have the DeniX repo enabled.

You can install denix-respin-tools using the yum program (or it's GUI, Package Manager).

Make sure you enabled the DeniX repository and type the following as root:

yum install denix-respin-tools

If you want to install this package manualy, download the latest version from one of my mirrors:

http://fedora.os.vc/yum/base/x1

and install it by using this command as root:

rpm -ivh denix-respin-tools.xx.x-xx.x1.noarch.rpm
